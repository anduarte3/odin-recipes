        <p><h2>Preparation:</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <h4>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, evenly season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, paprika, and parsley.</li>
            <li>On high, heat olive oil in a oven-proof pot and place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in the hot oil. Cook 5-6 minutes or the thighs develop brown crispy skin and flip over.</li>
            <li>Cook an additional 5-6 minutes to brown the other side and remove from the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and onions to the pot, and cook until the onions are transparent.</li>
            <li>Pour in the rice and chicken broth to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Stir well, bringing to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken thighs back into the pot, skin-side up, on top of the rice, bring back to a boil and cover with a lid.</li>
            <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>NOTE: For a crispy skin, remove chicken thighs and broil.</li>
